## Testing

1. Video Carousel
    1. Try to click on the video thumbnail cards for each video category; a corresponding YouTube/ Facebook video link opens. The shortcoming to this style of displaying video is that the user leaves Kashina's 
    site and has no navigation menu to return to Kashina's protfolio site.
    2. Found issue with Facebook link's page: is not ideal for UX due to the join facebook message that appears and covers the video link that is meant to view. 
    The user needs to click the close button on this modal prior to playing the video. The video settings by default set the audio to off which the viewer needs to turn on to listen to the video. 

2. Menu Navigation Bar
    1. Try to use the menu items 'home' 'about' and 'contact' and they work perfectly that when selected, the page name shifts in color to indicate the page that is currently active. 
    2. Try to view in mobile and the navbar menu collapses into a dropdown menu.
    3. Try to view in mobile and there is a size issue. The navbar covers Kashina's landing page phot covering her face. This needs some improvement.

3. Contact Form
    1. Try to submit form to Kashina's email and it works - confirmed that Kashina recieved an email from sent during the test from the form.

4. Call-to- Action gold button
    1. Try to select large gold 'email me' call-to-action button and it succesffully opened the 'Contact' page. This call-to-action 'email me' button is available on both the 'home' page and 'about' page. 
       On both pages the 'email' button links to 'contact' page.

5. About
    1. try to view the about text and call-to-action section on mobile and it failed. Both overlay on top of one another and proves non-responsive for mobile use. 

6. Footer
    1. try to view the footer and the copyright and social icon section are merged overlaying one another causing failure in text layout. This needs to be repaired.

7. Mobile First Responsive Design
    1. try to view all pages and they failed the resposive design test; the header is the only design that is responsive.

8. Browser
    1. try to test on Chrome browser and the website loads.
    2. The project had not been tested on other browsers.
